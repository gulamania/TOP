    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my favourites. I got it from a <a href = "https://youtu.be/JwPa3-_fNLI?si=CHyqJ8cRS_MuzHl-&t=443">video</a> on the youtube channel Chinese Cooking Demystified. Despite the kinda weird channel name I promise you that the food is actually good. This recipe makes approximately 4 servings when having it over rice and reheats nicely in the microwave if you place a wet rag or paper towel over the bowl.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 stalks of celery</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 inch of ginger</li>
            <li>100-150g of ground of minced beef</li>
            <li>Bread bean paste aka DouBianJang</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Rice Wine</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>MSG</li>
        </ul>
